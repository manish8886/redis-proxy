cache functionality:
 Adding to cache:
    Addding to cache can only happen when a client asks for a key which is not present in cache.
    When this happens query is done to backend store and that is saved as a most recently used entry.

Reading:
    When a key is already present in a cache no modification to cache happens.

Deletion:
    1: If a preconfigured timer is expired.
    2. If capacity of cache is reached.

Access to redis handles is syncronised that is a bootleneck.
